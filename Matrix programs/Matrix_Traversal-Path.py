# Matrix Traversal - Path
"""
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC, the position (X, Y) of a cell and a string P representing a path containing the characters >, v, < and ^ as the input. The path P always starts from the given cell (X, Y). The program must print the integers which are present in the given path P. The four characters in the path P representing the four directions.- The character > indicates that the next cell is on the right.- The character v indicates that the next cell is on the bottom.- The character < indicates that the next cell is on the left.- The character ^ indicates that the next cell is on the top.If the path P is not valid (i.e., if it crosses the edges of the matrix), the program must print the string value "Invalid Path" as the output.Boundary Condition(s):2 <= R, C <= 501 <= X <= R1 <= Y <= C1 <= Length of P <= 100Input Format:The first line contains R and C separated by a space.The next R lines, each contains C integers separated by a space.The (R+2)nd line contains X and Y separated by a space.The (R+3)rd line contains P.Output Format:The first line contains the integer value(s) present in the given path P or "Invalid Path".Example Input/Output 1:Input:5 51 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 01 2 3 4 51 2>>>vOutput:2 3 4 5 0Explanation:The starting position of the path is (1, 2).The path P is >>>v.The integers present in the given path P are highlighted below.1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 01 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 01 2 3 4 5Hence the output is2 3 4 5 0Example Input/Output 2:Input:3 41 2 3 45 6 7 81 2 3 01 1>>vv<v>Output:Invalid Path
